# Frontend Second Semester Examination Project.

Using vanilla css, react, react-router-dom, react-icons, Error boundary and no UI library i built my project.

We wre asked to implement a Web App using GitHub API to fetch your GitHub repositories portfolio.

By Showing a page listing all your repositories on GitHub with pagination enabled( Bonus: Implement Search and Filter) I used the useEffect() hook, .map(), useState, as well as a search and filter component to a achieve this.

Created another page showing data for a single repo when clicked from the page. Show all repos using nested routes while using all the necessary tools in React. I used the useEffect() hook, then the browser router, routes, route, Navlink in react-router-dom to achieve this.
Implement an Error Boundary (show a page to test the error boundary). By wrapping my whole application in it.
a 404 page  (show a page to test the 404 page).And i created a error page to test it out.
Good Layout, UI, and Designs are essential. I made my react application responsive and accessible with vanilla css.
